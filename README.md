# SignIn-GUI-Python-App
# Note: before running the files make sure you put it all in a folder called SignIn(so all the .py files are there) a UI folder for all the QML files and an images folder for the python and QML files to pull. 
Python based GUI app. Created a Signin page where user enters email password. used QTCreator and python to code as well as Ninja Preview. To run the code you can run it two ways. You can download Ninjia Preview and drag and drop the .qml files into the ninja preview and click the play button to run or you can use python by running the command python main.py (which is the app file that needs to run to dispaly the signin page). Coded on VS Code and QT Creator. Enjoy :).
