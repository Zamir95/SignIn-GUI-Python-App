# SignIn-GUI-Python-App

Python based GUI app. Created a Signin page where user enters email password. Coded on VS Code, QT Creator, and Python. To run the code you can run it two ways. You can download Ninja Preview and drag and drop the .qml files into the ninja preview and click the play button to run or you can downlaod and use Python by running the command python main.py (which is the app file that needs to run to dispaly the SignIn page). Enjoy :).
